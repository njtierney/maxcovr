#' Maximum Coverage when considering relocation
#'
#' This function adds a relocation step
#'
#' @param existing_facility data.frame containing the facilities that are
#'   already in existing, with columns names lat, and long.
#' @param proposed_facility data.frame containing the facilities that are
#'   being proposed, with column names lat, and long.
#' @param user data.frame containing the users of the facilities, along with
#'   column names lat, and long.
#' @param distance_cutoff numeric indicating the distance cutoff (in metres)
#'   you are interested in. If a number is less than distance_cutoff, it will be
#'   1, if it is greater than it, it will be 0.
#' @param solver character "glpk" (default) or "lpSolve". "gurobi" is currently
#'   in development, see <https://github.com/njtierney/maxcovr/issues/25>
#' @param cost_install integer the cost of installing a new facility
#' @param cost_removal integer the cost of removing a facility
#' @param cost_total integer the total cost allocated to the project
#' @param return_early logical TRUE if I do not want to run the extraction
#'   process, FALSE if I want to just return the lpsolve model etc.
