#' facility_user_dist
#'
#' Uses haversines formula to calculate the distance between lat/long
#'   co-ordinates of every facility and every user, returning a data_frame. You
#'   can think of "facilities" as something like mobile towers, police centres,
#'   or AED locations, and "users" as something like individual houses, crime
#'   locations, or heart attack locations. The motivating example for this
#'   function was finding the distance from Automatic Electronic Defibrillators
#'   (AEDs) to each Out of Hospital Cardiac Arrest (OHCA), where the locations
#'   for AEDs and OHCAs are in separate dataframes. Currently
#'   facifacility_user_dist makes the strict assumption that the facility and
#'   user dataframes have columns named aed_id, lat, and long, and ohca_id, lat,
#'   and long. This will be updated soon.
#'
#' @param facility a dataframe containing columns named "lat", and "long".
#' @param user a dataframe containing columns "lat", and "long".
#' @param coverage_distance numeric indicating the coverage level for the
#'   facilities to be within in metres to a user. Default value is 100 metres.
#' @param nearest character Can be "facility", "user", and "both". Defaults to
#'   "facility". When set to "facility", returns a dataframe where every row
#'   refers to every user, and the closest facility to each user. When set to
#'   "user", it returns a dataframe where every row is every facility, and the
#'   closest user to each facility. When set to "both", which will return every
#'   pairwise combination of distances. Be careful when default is "facility".
#'
#' @return a data frame containing the two datasets joined together with columns
#'   named facility_id, lat_facility, long_facility, user_id, lat_user,
#'   long_user, distance in meters between each the given facility and user in a
#'   row.
