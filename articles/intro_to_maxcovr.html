<p>maxcovr provides tools to make it easy to solve the “maximum covering
location problem”, a binary optimisation problem described by <a href="http://www.geog.ucsb.edu/~forest/G294download/MAX_COVER_RLC_CSR.pdf" class="external-link">Church</a>.</p>
<p><code>maxcovr</code> aims to provide researchers and analysts with an
easy to user, fast, accurate and (eventually) extensible implementation
of Church’s maximal covering location problem, while adhering as best as
it can to <a href="http://www.tidyverse.org" class="external-link"><code>tidyverse</code></a>
principles.</p>
<p>This vignette aims to get users started with using maxcovr. In this
vignette you will learn about:</p>
<ul>
<li>The motivation behind <code>maxcovr</code>
</li>
<li>How to assess current coverage of facilities</li>
<li>How to maximise coverage using some new proposed facilities</li>
<li>Explore results of the new locations</li>
<li>How to explore the new locations proposed</li>
</ul>
<p>Other vignettes provided in the package include:</p>
<ul>
<li>“Cross Validation with maxcovr”, which explains how to perform and
interpret cross validation results in a maximum covering location
framework</li>
<li>“Performing the maximal coverage relocation problem”</li>
</ul>

</h2>
<p><code>maxcovr</code> was created to make it easy for a non expert to
correctly solve the maximum covering location problem. This problem is
beginning to be applied in problems in <a href="">AED placement</a>, but
has been applied in <a href="">many different areas</a>. Many
implementations in papers apply commercial software such as AMPL,
Gurobi, or CPLEX. Additionally, the code that they use in the paper to
implement the optimisation is not provided, and has to be requested. As
a result, these analyses are more difficult to implement, and more
difficult to reproduce.</p>
<p><code>maxcovr</code> was created to address these shortcomings,
using:</p>
<ul>
<li>R, a free and open source language</li>
<li>Open source solvers, lpSolve, and glpk, that can be used on Linux,
Windows, and OSX.</li>
<li>Real-world, open source example data.</li>
<li>Tidyverse principles to design it for humans make it easy to use,
code, and extend.</li>
</ul>
<p>This means results are easy to implement, reproduce, and extend.</p>

<h2 id="the-problem">The problem<a class="anchor" aria-label="anchor" href="#the-problem"></a>
</h2>
<p>Consider the toy example where we want to place crime surveillance
towers to detect crime. We have two datasets, <code>york</code>, and
<code>york_crime</code>:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<code>york</code> contains listed building GPS locations in the city
of York, provided by the city of york</li>
<li>
<code>york_crime</code> contains a set of crime data from the <a href="https://www.github.com/njtierney/ukpolice" class="external-link"><code>ukpolice</code>
package</a>, containing crime data from September 2016.</li>
</ul>
<p>We already have a few surveillance towers built, which are placed on
top of the listed buildings with a grade of I. We will call this dataset
<code>york_existing</code>, and the remaining building locations
<code>york_proposed</code>. Here, <code>york_existing</code> is the
currently locations of facilities, and <code>york_proposed</code> is the
potential facility locations.</p>

<p>We are interested in placing surveillance towers so that they are
within 100m of the largest number of crimes. We are going to use the
crime data that we have to help us choose ideal locations to place
towers.</p>
<p>This can be illustrated with the following graphic, where the red
circles indicate the current coverage of the building locations, so
those blue crimes within the circles are within the coverage.</p>

the coverage looks OK, but to get a better estimate, we can
verify the coverage using the <code><a href="../reference/nearest.html">nearest()</a></code> function.</p>
<p><code><a href="../reference/nearest.html">nearest()</a></code> takes two dataframes and returns the nearest
lat/long coords from the first dataframe to the second dataframe, along
with the distances between them and the appropriate columns from the
building dataframe. You can think of reading this as “What is the
nearest (nearest_df) to (to_df)”.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Note that <code>maxcovr</code> records the positions of locations
must be named “lat” and “long” for latitude and longitude,
respectively.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The dataframe <code>dat_dist</code> contains the nearest proposed
facility to each crime. This means that we have a dataframe that
contains “to_id” - the ID number (labelled from 1 to the number of rows
in the to dataset), “nearest_id” describes the row numer of “nearest_df”
that corresponds to the row location of that data.frame. We also have
the rest of the columns of <code>york_crime</code>. These are returned
to make it easy to do other data manipulation / exploration tasks, if
you wish.</p>
<p>You can instead return a dataframe which has every building in the
rows, and the nearest crime to the building, by simply changing the
order.</p>

<p>This contains useful summary information:</p>
<ul>
<li>distance_within - this is the distance used to determine
coverae</li>
<li>n_cov - this is the number of events that are covered</li>
<li>n_not_cov - the number of events not covered</li>
<li>pct_cov - the proportion of events covered</li>
<li>pct_not_cov - the proportion of events not covered</li>
<li>dist_avg - the average distance from the rows to the nearest
facility or user</li>
<li>dist_avg - the standard deviation of the distance from the rows to
the nearest facility or user.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tells us that out of all the crime, 37.76% of it is within 100m,
339 crimes are covered, but the mean distance to the surveillance camera
is 1400m.</p>

<div class="section level2">

</h2>
<p>Knowing this information, you might be interested in improving this
coverage. To do so we can use the <code>max_coverage</code>
function.</p>
<p>This function takes 5 arguments:</p>
<ul>
<li>existing_facility = the facilities currently installed</li>
<li>proposed_facility = the facilities proposed to install</li>
<li>user = the users that you want to maximise coverage over</li>
<li>n_added = the number of new facilities that you can install</li>
<li>distance_cutoff = the distance that we consider coverage to be
within.</li>
</ul>
<p>Similar to using <code>nearest</code> - the data frames for
existing_facility, proposed_facility, and user need to contain columns
of latitude and longitude, and they must be named “lat”, and “long”,
respectively. These are used to calculate the distance.</p>

<p>Here this tells us useful information about the distance cutoff, the
number of facilities added, and the number of users covered, and
previousl, and the proportion of events covered.</p>
<p>To get this information out we can use the information in each of the
columns below. The information each of these is a list, which might seem
strange, but it becomes very useful when you are assessing different
levels of <code>n_added</code>. We will go into more detail for this
soon.</p>
<p>Firstly, we have the data input into <code>n_added</code> and
<code>distance_cutoff</code> - the same information that we entered.</p>
